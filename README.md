# Project 2 - Methodology for Star Detection through Luminosity Peaks

## About

This project aims to test the possibility of detecting the approximate number of stars in an image by identifying the luminosity peaks produced by the stars in relation to the sky background flux.

## Libraries Used

- scipy: 1.11.3
- numpy: 1.23.5
